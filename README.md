## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate decision making on consideration for running a short term rental property in the area.  Short term rentals offer a unique alternative to traditional hotel/motel stays and present the opportunity for a property owner to generate income from an otherwise unoccupied residence or room.  Utilizing several datasets taken from Inside Airbnb (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data) for Hawaii, the goal is to answer several questions pertinent to entry into the short term rental business model.

### Questions to answer:
1. Which neighborhoods have the most rental properties, and which neighborhoods generate the most revenue?
2. Which property/room type is booked most often?
3. What are the most influential factors (amenities) for drawing rentals and commanding a higher pricepoint?
4. When is the peak season for rentals, and when can maintenance and repairs be performed?

### Methods utilized:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing - Pandas, Jupyter Notebook
2. Data storage and queries - PGAdmin, SQL, AWS
3. Modeling and Learning - Simple Linear Regression
4. Visualizations - Tableau, Wordcloud

### Communication protocols:
We worked on the project as a group during class, and keep updated the status of the project through Slack and weekend zoom meetups. 
#### Team member role: 
* Ryan: Created the flowchart for the Machine Learning Model, generated a wordcloud for reviews, edit the README.
